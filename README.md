# Autocomplete System: Trie vs Ternary Search Tree

This project is an autocomplete system that compares two core data structures **Trie** and **Ternary Search Tree (TST)** in terms of performance, memory efficiency, and accuracy. 

The system provides real-time suggestions for word completions based on prefix inputs, optimized using frequency-based relevance filtering.

##  What the Program Does

- Accepts user input via a Java Swing-based UI
- Provides autocomplete suggestions based on prefix input
- Uses two interchangeable backend data structures: **Trie** and **TST**
- Ranks suggestions based on word frequency using a **priority queue**
- Allows comparison of runtime performance between the two data structures

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Efficient Autocompletion**: Suggests top K (default 5) most relevant words based on prefix input.
- **Frequency-Based Ranking**: Words with higher search frequency are prioritized.
- **Two Backend Modes**: Easily switch between Trie and TST to compare their behavior.
- **Java Swing UI**: Simple GUI interface to enter prefixes and view real-time suggestions.
